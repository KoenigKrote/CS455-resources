# Golang RMI/RPC

RPC and RMI are technically distinct from one another.  Golang supports _RPC_ specifically, but in its implemenation is much closer to RMI both syntactically and conceptually.  This is being pointed out because the official Go library is called _RPC_ and not _RMI_, even though this folder is called _RMI_
